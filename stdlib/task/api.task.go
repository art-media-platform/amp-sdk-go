// Context is an expanded form of a context.Context offering, featuring:
//   - integrated logging, removing guesswork of which Context logged what
//   - "child" Contexts such that Close() will cause a Context's children to close
//   - automatic idle-close of Contexts after a period of inactivity
//   - the OnClosing() hook, allowing cleanup to occur  when a Context is closed but before its parent is closed.
//   - PrintTreePeriodically() which visualizes a Context's child tree and is helpful for debugging in large projects.
